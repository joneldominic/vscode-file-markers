# File Markers v1.0.1 Marketplace Polish Plan

## Overview

Prepare File Markers extension for VSCode Marketplace publication. This release focuses on documentation, visual assets, and package metadata required for a polished marketplace listing.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Complete:
- ✅ All v1.0.0 features implemented and working
- ✅ LICENSE file (MIT)
- ✅ Basic README.md structure
- ✅ Basic .vscodeignore

### What's Missing for Marketplace:

| Item | Status | Required? |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Publisher ID in package.json | ❌ Missing | **Yes** |
| Repository URL in package.json | ❌ Missing | Yes (warning) |
| Keywords in package.json | ❌ Missing | Recommended |
| Icon (128x128 PNG) | ❌ Missing | Recommended |
| Gallery banner | ❌ Missing | Recommended |
| Updated README with features | ❌ Outdated | **Yes** |
| Demo GIF/screenshots | ❌ Missing | Recommended |
| CHANGELOG with versions | ❌ Default template | Recommended |
| Shields.io badges | ❌ Missing | Recommended |
| .vscodeignore updates | ⚠️ Incomplete | Recommended |

## Desired End State

After implementation:
1. Package can be published via `vsce publish` without errors
2. Marketplace listing shows professional icon and banner
3. README displays feature GIFs and badges
4. CHANGELOG documents all releases (v0.1.0 through v1.0.0)
5. Package excludes unnecessary files (thoughts/, PRD.md, etc.)

### Verification:
- Run `vsce package` successfully (creates .vsix file)
- Run `vsce ls` to verify included files are minimal
- Install .vsix locally and verify all features work
- README renders correctly on GitHub

## What We're NOT Doing

- Creating a publisher account (user will do this themselves)
- Actually publishing to marketplace (user decision)
- Adding automated tests
- Adding CI/CD pipeline
- Implementing new features

## Implementation Approach

1. Update package.json with marketplace metadata
2. Create extension icon (will describe specifications for user to create)
3. Update README with full feature documentation
4. Update CHANGELOG with version history
5. Update .vscodeignore to exclude dev files
6. Test packaging with vsce

---

## Phase 1: Update package.json Metadata

### Overview

Add all required and recommended fields for marketplace publishing.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Update package.json with Marketplace Fields

**File**: `package.json`
**Changes**: Add/update the following fields

After the `"version"` field, add:
```json
  "publisher": "joneldominic",
```

After `"categories"`, add:
```json
  "keywords": [
    "file",
    "marker",
    "badge",
    "explorer",
    "status",
    "tracking",
    "migration",
    "refactoring",
    "productivity",
    "workflow"
  ],
  "icon": "images/icon.png",
  "galleryBanner": {
    "color": "#1e1e1e",
    "theme": "dark"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/joneldominic/file-markers-vscode"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/joneldominic/file-markers-vscode#readme",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/joneldominic/file-markers-vscode/issues"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "pricing": "Free",
```

**Note**: The `publisher` field must match the publisher ID you create on the VSCode Marketplace. Replace `"joneldominic"` with your actual publisher ID.

**Note**: The repository URLs assume `file-markers-vscode` as the repo name. Update if different.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Extension compiles: `pnpm run compile`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `pnpm run check-types`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Review package.json for correct field values
- [ ] Confirm publisher ID matches your Marketplace publisher

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Create Extension Icon

### Overview

Create a 256x256 PNG icon for the extension. The icon appears in the Marketplace listing and VSCode's Extensions view.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Create Images Directory and Icon

**Directory**: `images/`
**File**: `images/icon.png`

**Icon Specifications:**
- **Size**: 256x256 pixels (displays at 128x128, 256 for retina)
- **Format**: PNG only (SVG not allowed)
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color
- **Design suggestions**:
  - A file/document icon with a checkmark badge
  - Or a bookmark/flag icon
  - Use green/blue as primary colors (professional, productivity feel)
  - Simple, recognizable at small sizes

**Option A - Simple text-based placeholder:**
You can use any image editor or online tool to create a simple icon. For a quick placeholder:
- Create 256x256 canvas
- Add a file icon shape
- Add a checkmark or marker badge overlay
- Export as PNG

**Option B - Use an icon generator:**
- Canva, Figma, or similar tools
- Search for "file check" or "document badge" templates

#### 2. Verify Icon Path in package.json

Ensure package.json has:
```json
  "icon": "images/icon.png",
```

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] File exists: `ls images/icon.png`
- [ ] File is PNG: `file images/icon.png`
- [ ] Size is at least 128x128: `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight images/icon.png` (macOS)

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Icon looks good at small sizes (32x32 preview)
- [ ] Icon has transparent or appropriate background
- [ ] Icon represents the extension's purpose

**Implementation Note**: This phase requires manual asset creation. After the icon is created, proceed to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: Update README with Full Documentation

### Overview

Rewrite README.md to showcase all v1.0.0 features with badges, GIFs/screenshots, and clear documentation.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Replace README.md Content

**File**: `README.md`
**Content**:

```markdown
